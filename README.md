# FocusAIder EBM140 group 7

This project is based on the following repository: https://github.com/sherkhan15/distarctor-Detection_Eyes_Emotions_CI

The project was build upon by our group to include our parts of our design for the FocusAIder. It can pause the recording depending on the calculated CI-values and explain why it paused the recording. When the recording is ended an overview of the calculated variables are given. 

To run start the program run_local_cv.py
